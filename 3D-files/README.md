# Inventory
File for keeping an inventory of the 3D-files. The manufacturing folder is for files such as `.stl`or `.dxf` that are possible to use immediately in a 3D-printer slicer or in the laser cutter. Please update when introducing new files to the folders and make sure to follow the established format in this documentation.

## [*Controller-DC-DC_box.f3d*](/NIMBUS/3D-files/Controller_DC-DC_box.f3d)
A box to house the DC-DC converters from battery to controllers. Has a window for displaying the battery voltage, should be covered with acrylic for a more dust-proof setup.
- [x] Has manufacturing files

## [*Here3_mount.f3d*](/NIMBUS/3D-files/Here3_mount.f3d)
3D-file for mounting the HERE3 GPS-module on the aircraft. Contains two bodies. One is for mounting the HERE3 to and the other is for securing the mount to the aircraft. The bottom is a plate that can be laser-cut. Therefor the manufacturing files are one `.stl` and one `.dxf`, the latter to be used for the laser cutter.
- [x] Has manufacturing files

## [*Wheel_mount.f3d*](/NIMBUS/3D-files/Wheel_mount.f3d)
A base for mounting the wheels to the aircraft. Can be 3D-printed. If it breaks in the future, consider using another manufacturing method. Maybe cutting a thicker base in laser cutter and using some solid rods and glue. Something that avoids the weakness of layers.  
- [x] Has manufacturing files

## [*FC_mount.dxf*](/NIMBUS/3D-files/Manufacturing/FC_mount.dxf)
A mount for the flight controller. Made to be laser cut. No 3D file is supplied as it should not be printed. Made as an adapter from the old mount that held the outgoing Pixhawk FC to the new Cube Orange+.
